    }

    render() {
        return(
            <div>
                <CountDown
                    deadline="August 22, 2022"

        );
    }
}

export default Something;
```

## Other Config

You can stop the countdown timer anytime by passing `true` (Boolean) with `stop` props.

You can change the language of the text to French by passing `FR` (String) with `format` props.

```
<Countdown
    format="FR"
    deadline="September 22, 2023"
/>
```

### Caution 

Please don't provide any confusing date format since it has no dependency to Moment.js or any other date helpers. You can check [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse#Examples) more date format.
